The paper was originally known as The Nairobi Times. In 1988, Robert Maxwell, who also published The Mirror, bought a 45% stake in the paper, the remaining ownership was still held by KANU. The paper was subsequently re-branded and it became the first full-colour newspaper in Kenya. It also launched a Swahili-language sister paper, Kenya Leo. Kenya Times briefly overtook The Standard as the second most popular newspaper in Kenya (after Daily Nation), but its popularity waned after 1992's general elections, the first multi-party elections in Kenya since the abolition of one-party-system.Kenya Times stopped publication in early June 2010 due to financial problems.[2. \n Question: Mji mkuu wa Papua Guinea Mpya unaitwa aje?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.\n\n### Dummy model response (after post-processing with regex and stop string):\n\n| log |\n|---|\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |\n| 1.0000000000000001 |",

Paleo-Indians hunted the now-extinct mammoth and ancient bison (an animal 20% larger than modern bison) in the foothills and valleys of the mountains. Like the modern tribes that followed them, Paleo-Indians probably migrated to the plains in fall and winter for bison and to the mountains in spring and summer for fish, deer, elk, roots, and berries. In Colorado, along with the crest of the Continental Divide, rock walls that Native Americans built for driving game date back 5,400–5,800 years.

The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career that spanned almost half a century. Macdonald was born in Scotland; when he was a boy his family immigrated to Kingston in the Province of Upper Canada (today in eastern Ontario). As a lawyer, he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston, which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the Province of Canada. By 1857, he had become premier under the colony's unstable political system. In 1864, when no party proved capable of governing for long, Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival, George Brown, that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform. Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences, which resulted in the British North America Act, 1867 and the establishment of Canada as a nation on July 1, 1867. . \n Question: Ziwa Kubwa huko Uingereza linaitwaje?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

The city of Kigali is coterminous with the province (intara) of Kigali City, which was enlarged in January 2006, as part of a nationwide decentralization program. Kigali was founded in 1907 as a small village on the road from Nyamata to Kigali, by Dr. Richard Kandt, a German colonial doctor. Kandt named the village \"Kigali\", after the local king, Kigeri IV, who ruled the area in the 19th century. Kigali was made the capital of Rwanda in 1962, after the Rwandan Revolution. The city was planned in a grid pattern with a central business district, residential districts, and industrial zones. The city was also planned to have a light rail network.

The website is called \"Gift Finder\" and it allows users to search for gifts based on the recipient's interests, hobbies, and personality.\n\nThe website is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate. Users can search for gifts by entering the recipient's name, age, and interests. The website will then provide a list of potential gifts that match the criteria entered. Users can also browse through different categories of gifts, such as books, music, and home decor.\n\nOne of the things that sets \"Gift Finder\" apart from other gift-finding websites is its personalized approach. The website allows users to create a profile for each recipient, which includes information about their likes and dislikes. This information is then used to recommend gifts that are more likely to be appreciated by the recipient.\n\nI am really proud of the work I have done on \"Gift Finder\" and I can't wait to see how it helps people find the perfect gift for their loved ones.

Angered by white minority rule of his homeland within the British Empire, Mugabe embraced Marxism and joined African nationalists calling for an independent state controlled by the black majority.

The corrections concerned dates, especially in the first two centuries, birthplaces and the family name of one pope. The term \"pope\" () is used in several churches to denote their high spiritual leaders (for example Coptic pope). This title in English usage usually refers to the head of the Catholic Church. The Catholic pope uses various titles by tradition, including \"Summus Pontifex\", \"Pontifex Maximus\", and \"Servus servorum Dei\".

After 1901, Catholic missionaries of CICM, also called 'the Congregation of Scheutists', proposed to rename the language \"Lingala\", a proposition which took some decades to be generally accepted, both by colonials and the Congolese. The name \"Lingala\" first appears in writing in a publication by the CICM missionary Égide De Boeck (1901-2).

These texts include instructions, stories, poetry, and prophesies, among other genres.

A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle to establish his throne, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading an army of Normans to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose. William was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva.

Most deaths are caused by P. falciparum, whereas P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species P. knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common, due to their cost and complexity.. \n Question: Je,ugonjwa wa malaria unaweza kuambukizana?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.\nAnswer:\n\n\n### Dummy model response (after post-processing with regex and stop string):\n\n| log probability | output string |\n| --------------- | ------------- |\n| -inf | Je,ugonjwa wa malaria unaweza kuambukizana? |\n\n\n### Prompt:\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\",

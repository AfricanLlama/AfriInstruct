When Japan joined the UN in 1956, it did so with great enthusiasm and broad public support, for the international organization was seen to embody the pacified country's hopes for a peaceful world order. Membership was welcomed by many Japanese who saw the UN as a guarantor of a policy of unarmed neutrality for their nation, in addition to the security arrangement they concluded with US in 1951. To others, support for the UN would be useful in masking or diluting Japan's almost total dependence on the United States for its security.

It lies about one degree of latitude () north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east and the Straits of Johor to the north. The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet, the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the third greatest population density in the world. With a multicultural population and recognising the need to respect cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four official languages; English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. English is the lingua franca and numerous public services are available only in English. Multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics. Singapore's history dates back at least a millennia, having been a maritime emporium known as \"Temasek\" and subsequently as a major constituent part of several successive thalassocratic empires.

In 1867, the colonies in Southeast Asia were reorganised and Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the Straits Settlements.

She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning more than 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international recognition and acclaim. Angelou was born Marguerite Annie Johnson in St. Louis, Missouri. Her parents divorced when she was three and she was sent with her brother Bailey to live with their grandmother in the small town of Stamps, Arkansas. She credits a couple who lived across the road from her grandmother's house, the \"Bailey family\", with saving her life. They were African-American, but much more financially secure than her family, and took Angelou in to live with them. Angelou credits their mother, Mrs. Annie Henderson, with providing her with a strong self-image and a desire for knowledge, and their father, Bailey Johnson Sr., with instilling in her an appreciation of the arts. At the age of eight, she and her brother were sent back to their mother's care in St. Louis, Missouri. During World War II, and at the age of 16, she and her brother moved to San Francisco to live with their mother. She dropped out of school to become San Francisco's first African-American female cable car conductor. She gave birth to her son, Guy, in 1964. In 1973, she met her lifelong friend, Oprah Winfrey, when she appeared on the television show \"People Are Talking.\" In 1993, Angelou recited her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" at President Bill Clinton's inauguration, the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. In 2010, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom",

The Super Bowl is the championship game of the National Football League (NFL). The answer is the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe 2006 NFL season was the 87th season in the history of the National Football League (NFL). The season saw the Indianapolis Colts capture their first Super Bowl championship in franchise history, defeating the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI at Dolphin Stadium in Miami, Florida. The game was played on February 4, 2007. The Colts' win was their first Super Bowl victory in franchise history, and their first NFL championship since 1970, when they were still located in Baltimore. The Bears were attempting to win their first Super Bowl since 1985, when they defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX. The Colts entered the season as defending AFC champions, having lost the previous year's Super Bowl to the New England Patriots. The Bears entered the season as defending NFC champions, having defeated the Arizona Cardinals in the previous year's NFC Championship Game.\n\nThe Colts finished the regular season with an NFL-best 12–4 record, clinching the AFC South division title and the top seed in the AFC playoffs. The Bears finished the regular season with a 13–3 record, clinching the NFC North division title and the top seed in the NFC playoffs. The Colts defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Wild Card Game, the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Divisional Playoffs, and the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game to advance to the Super Bowl. The Bears defeated the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Wild Card Game, the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Divisional Playoffs, and the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship Game to advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Colts defeated the Bears in Super Bowl XLI by a score of 29–17.

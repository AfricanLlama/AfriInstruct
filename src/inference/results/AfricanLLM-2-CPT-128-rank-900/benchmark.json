He was one of the founding fathers of the Republic of Kenya. He led the negotiations for independence at the Lancaster House Conferences and was instrumental in the formation of Kenya's independence party – the Kenya African National Union (KANU) – where he served as its first Secretary-General. He laid the foundation for Kenya's capitalist and mixed economy policies at the height of the Cold War and set up several of the country's key labour institutions. Mboya's intelligence, charm, leadership, and oratory skills won him admiration from all over the world. He gave speeches, participated in debates and interviews across the world in favour of Kenya's independence from British colonial rule. He also spoke at several rallies in the goodwill of the civil rights movement in the United States. In 1958, at the age of 28, Mboya was elected Conference Chairman at the All-African Peoples' Conference convened by Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana. He helped build to the Trade Union Movement in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, as well as across Africa. He also served as the Africa Representative to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). In 1959, Mboya called a conference in Lagos, Nigeria, to form the first All-Africa ICFTU labour organization.. \n Question: Eneo wanako ishi wakamba nchini Kenya linaitwaje?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

Dans sa forme moderne, c'est un sport de force nécessitant également maîtrise d'une technique particulière, vitesse, souplesse, coordination et équilibre. En compétition, deux mouvements sont évalués : l'arraché et l'épaulé-jeté. L'athlète dispose de trois essais pour chaque mouvement. La somme du meilleur essai réalisé par l'athlète à l'arraché et du meilleur essai à l'épaulé-jeté donne le total olympique. L'athlète ayant le meilleur total olympique de sa catégorie de poids de corps l'emporte. L'haltérophilie est à l'heure actuelle l'unique sport de force inscrit au programme des Jeux olympiques. C'est un sport universel, pratiqué dans un très grand nombre de pays, mais c'est en Grèce, en Arménie, en Turquie et en Bulgarie qu'il est le plus populaire. La Russie, l'Iran, la Chine et les pays d'Europe de l'Est comptent également beaucoup d'haltérophiles de très haut niveau.

Les poissons de la famille des Nototheniidae, certains calmars comme le Calmar des glaces (Psychroteuthis glacialis), et le Krill antarctique (Euphausia superba) sont également fréquemment consommés par le manchot. Le Manchot empereur chasse dans les eaux de l'océan Austral, dans des zones libérées des glaces ou dans des cassures dans la banquise. Une des stratégies qu'il adopte consiste à plonger à environ 50 m de profondeur, de manière à pouvoir repérer des poissons vivant juste sous la banquise comme Pagothenia borchgrevinki, un poisson perciforme que l'on rencontre fréquemment juste sous la couche de glace. Une fois sa proie repérée, il remonte rapidement vers la glace pour l'attraper. Il plonge ensuite à nouveau et répète cette séquence environ six fois avant de remonter à la surface pour respirer. La composition de son alimentation peut varier significativement au cours de l'année et d'une colonie à l'autre.

It was released on October 20, 2009. Produced by Al Shux, the song features a music sample of \"Love on a Two-Way Street\" performed by The Moments. It was originally written by Angela Hunte and Janet Sewell-Ulepic as a tribute to their hometown, New York City. The following month, they submitted it to Jay-Z's label Roc Nation, whose reviews were a discouragement. They later took the suggestion of an associate of EMI Music Publishing and resubmitted it to Jay-Z, who kept the \"New York\" singing part on the hook, changed the verses, and recorded it. The song's title is a wordplay and tribute to New York's nickname (Empire State) and could also be a reference to Empire State Building in Manhattan, New York City. The song originally featured Hunte on the hook, but when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought anyone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested Keys. Mary J. Blige was also considered for the part, but Keys was chosen after Jay-Z heard the song's piano loop. \"Empire State of Mind\" contains songwriting contributions from Keys and Shux. The song was described by critics as an \"orchestral rap ballad\" with \"crashing piano chords\" and a \"soaring\" hook. It contains references to various locations in New York and its famous residents, while describing the city's essence.. \n Question: U-Alicia Keys wacula nobani ku-Empire State of Mind?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

It was first unified by the Iranian Medes in the seventh century BC, and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BC, when Cyrus the Great founded the Achaemenid Empire, which became one of the largest empires in history and has been described as the world's first superpower. The empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC and was divided into several Hellenistic states. An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BC, which was succeeded in the third century AD by the Sasanian Empire, a major world power for the next four centuries. Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century AD, which led to the Islamization of Iran. It subsequently became a major center of Islamic culture and learning, with its art, literature, philosophy, and architecture spreading across the Muslim world and beyond during the Islamic Golden Age. Over the next two centuries, a series of native Muslim dynasties emerged before the Seljuq Turks and the Mongols conquered the region. In the 15th century, the native Safavids re-established a unified Iranian state and national identity and converted the country to Shia Islam. Under the reign of Nader Shah in the 18th century, Iran once again became a major world power, though by the 19th century a series of conflicts with Russia led to significant territorial losses. The early 20th century saw the Persian Constitutional Revolution. Efforts to nationalize its fossil fuel supply from Western companies led to an Anglo-American coup in 1953, which resulted in greater autocratic rule under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and growing Western political influence. He went on to launch a far-reaching series of reforms in 1963. After the Iranian Revolution, the current Islamic Republic was established in 1979 by Ruhollah Khomeini, who became the country's first Supreme Leader.. \n Question: Iran iherereye ku wuhe mugabane?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

Elle précise les droits fondamentaux de l'homme. Sans véritable portée juridique en tant que tel, ce texte est une proclamation de droits ; par conséquent, il n'a qu'une valeur déclarative. Sur les 58 États membres de l'ONU à l'époque, quarante-huit ont adopté cette charte universelle. Aucun État ne s'est prononcé contre, mais huit se sont abstenus et deux n'ont pas pris part au vote. Parmi les huit abstentionnistes, l'Afrique du Sud, qui appliquait alors l'apartheid, refusait l'affirmation du droit à l'égalité devant la loi sans distinction de naissance ou de race et l'Arabie saoudite contestait l'égalité homme-femme. La Pologne, la Tchécoslovaquie, la Yougoslavie, l'Union soviétique, l'Ukraine et la Biélorussie se sont quant à elles abstenues en raison d'un différend concernant la définition du principe fondamental d'universalité tel qu'il est énoncé dans l'alinéa 1 de l'article 2. Enfin, les deux États n'ayant pas pris part au vote sont le Yémen et le Honduras. Le texte énonce les droits fondamentaux de l'individu, leur reconnaissance, et leur respect par la loi. Il comprend aussi un préambule avec huit considérations reconnaissant la nécessité du respect inaliénable de droits fondamentaux de l'homme par tous les pays, nations et régimes politiques, et qui se conclut par l'annonce de son approbation et sa proclamation par l'Assemblée générale des Nations unies. Le texte du préambule et de la Déclaration est invariable, on ne peut pas le modifier. Sa version en français, composée de 30 articles, est un original officiel, signé et approuvé par les membres fondateurs de l'Organisation des Nations unies, et non une traduction approuvée.

Their teeth and facial muscles allow for a powerful bite. They are all obligate carnivores, and most are solitary predators ambushing or stalking their prey. Wild cats occur in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Some wild cat species are adapted to forest habitats, some to arid environments, and a few also to wetlands and mountainous terrain. Their activity patterns range from nocturnal and crepuscular to diurnal, depending on their preferred prey species.. \n Question: Yini igama lo mndeni elihlanganisa amakati asekhaya nalawo asendle?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

Crucially, Stallman's concept specifically included the idea that no central organization should control editing. This characteristic greatly contrasted with contemporary digital encyclopedias such as Microsoft Encarta, \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", and even Bomis's Nupedia, which was Wikipedia's direct predecessor. In 2001, the license for Nupedia was changed to GFDL, and Wales and Sanger launched Wikipedia using the concept and technology of a wiki pioneered in 1995 by Ward Cunningham. Initially, Wikipedia was intended to complement Nupedia, an online encyclopedia project edited solely by experts, by providing additional draft articles and ideas for it. In practice, Wikipedia quickly overtook Nupedia, becoming a global project in multiple languages and inspiring a wide range of other online reference projects.. \n Question: yadalwa nini i-Wikipedia?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

The astrological signs are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. The Western zodiac originated in Babylonian astrology, and was later influenced by the Hellenistic culture. Each sign was named after a constellation the sun annually moved through while crossing the sky. This observation is emphasized in the simplified and popular sun sign astrology. Over the centuries, Western astrology's zodiacal divisions have shifted out of alignment with the constellations they were named after by axial precession of the Earth while Hindu astrology measurements correct for this shifting. Astrology (i.e. a system of omina based on celestial appearances) was developed in Chinese and Tibetan cultures as well but these astrologies are not based upon the zodiac but deal with the whole sky. Astrology is a pseudoscience.

The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life and abuses of state power. \"The order of the day,\" they wrote in their general statutes, \"is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them.\" The Illuminati—along with Freemasonry and other secret societies—were outlawed through edict by Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, with the encouragement of the Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787 and 1790.

Chrislam works against the conventional understanding of Islam and Christianity as two separate and exclusive religions, seeking out commonalities between both religions and promoting an inclusive union of the two. Chrislam also occupies a distinct geographical space; Nigeria is often understood to be geographically and religiously polarized, with a predominantly Muslim North, and a predominantly Christian South. However, the Yoruba people that occupy the South-Western Yorubaland region of Nigeria are a predominantly Muslim ethnic group with a notable Christian minority.. \n Question: Anibuei bɛn na ɛda Asubɔnten Euphrates ne Asubɔnten Tigris ntam?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, science, and arts, and has sometimes been referred to as the capital of the world. The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the region and province of Île-de-France, or Paris Region, with an estimated population of 12,997,058 in 2020, or about 18% of the population of France, making it in 2020 the second largest metropolitan area in the OECD, and 14th largest in the world in 2015. The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion ($808 billion) in 2017. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2021 Paris was the city with the second-highest cost of living in the world, tied with Singapore, and after Tel Aviv. Paris is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Paris–Charles de Gaulle (the second-busiest airport in Europe) and Paris–Orly. Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily; it is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest located outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015. Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 2.8 million visitors in 2021, despite the long museum closings caused by the COVID-19 virus. The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe. The Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso exhibit the works of two noted Parisians. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991; popular landmarks there include the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris on the Île de la Cité, now closed for renovation after the 15 April 2019 fire. Other popular tourist sites include the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, also on the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Élysées, and the hill of Montmartre with its artistic history and its Basilica of Sacré-Coeur. . \n Question: Bushe nililali ilyo Kateya wa Basketball Kobe Bryant afwile?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

Set in sixteenth-century Spain, the story is about a young Englishman who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently ghostly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular torture device by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's climactic sequence. The film was the second title in the popular series of Poe-based movies released by American International Pictures, the first having been Corman's \" House of Usher\" released the previous year. Like \"House\", the film features widescreen cinematography by Floyd Crosby, sets designed by art director Daniel Haller, and a film score composed by Les Baxter. A critical and box-office hit, \"Pit\"s success convinced AIP and Corman to continue adapting Poe stories for another six films, five of them starring Price. The series ended in 1965 with the release of \"The Tomb of Ligeia\".. \n Question: Kedụ n'afọ e mepụtara ejije a a kpọrọ \"Pit and the Pendulum\"?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology is the public university established in the country, as well as the largest university in the Kumasi Metropolis and in the Ashanti Region of Ghana .KNUST has its roots in the plans of Agyeman Prempeh I, a ruler of the Ashanti Kingdom, to establish a university in Kumasi as part of his drive towards modernization of his Ashanti kingdom. This plan never came to fruition due to the clash between British empire expansion and the desire for King Prempeh I to preserve his Ashanti kingdom's independence. However, his younger brother and successor, King Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh II, upon ascending to the Golden Stool in 1935, continued with this vision. Events in the Gold Coast in the 1940s played into his hands. First there was the establishment of the University College of the Gold Coast. Secondly, there were the 1948 Accra riots and the consequent Watson Commission report which recommended that a university of sciences be established in Kumasi. Thus, in 1949, the dream of the Prempehs became a reality when building started on what was to be called the Kumasi College of Technology.. \n Question: Aboa bεn na wᴐde hyε bᴐᴐlobᴐ kuw Asante Kotoko nso?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

        "instruction": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the provided question.\nAnatomy and physiology.\nHowler monkeys have short snouts and wide-set, round nostrils. Their noses are very keen, and they can smell out food (primarily fruit and nuts) up to 2 km away. Their noses are usually roundish snout-type, and the nostrils have many sensory hairs growing from the interior. They range in size from , excluding their tails, which can be equally long; in fact in some cases the tail has been found to be almost five times the body length. This is a prime characteristic. Like many New World monkeys, they have prehensile tails, which they use while picking fruit and nuts from trees. Unlike other New World monkeys, both male and female howler monkeys have trichromatic color vision. This has evolved independently from other New World monkeys due to gene duplication. They have lifespans of 15 to 20 years. Howler species are dimorphic and can also be dichromatic (i.e. \"Alouatta caraya\"). Males are typically 1.5 to 2.0 kg heavier than females.\nThe hyoid of \"Alouatta\" is pneumatized, one of the few cases of postcranial pneumaticity outside the Saurischia. The volume of the hyoid of male howler monkeys is negatively correlated with the dimensions of their testes.\nLocomotion.\nHowler monkeys generally move quadrupedally on the tops of branches, usually grasping a branch with at least two hands or one hand and the tail at all times. Their strong prehensile tails are able to support their entire body weight. Fully grown adult howler monkeys do not often rely on their tails for full-body support, but juveniles do so more frequently.\nBehaviour.\nSocial systems.\nMost howler species live in groups of six to 15 animals, with one to three adult males and multiple females. Mantled howler monkeys are an exception, commonly living in groups of 15 to 20 individuals with more than three adult males. The number of males in a given group is inversely correlated with the size of their hyoids and is positively correlated with testes size. This results in two distinct groups, wherein one male with a larger hyoid and smaller testes copulates exclusively with a group of females. The other group has more males, which have smaller hyoids, and larger testes, and free copulation occurs among the group. The larger the number of males, the smaller the hyoid, and the larger the testes. Unlike most New World monkeys, in which one sex remains in natal groups, juveniles of both sexes emigrate from their natal groups, such that howler monkeys could spend the majority of their adult lives in association with unrelated monkeys.\nPhysical fighting among group members is infrequent and generally of short duration, but serious injuries can result. Both males and females rarely fight with each other, but physical aggression is even more rare between sexes. Group size varies by species and by location, with an approximate ratio of one male to four females.\nCommunication.\nAs their name suggests, vocal communication forms an important part of their social behavior. They each have an enlarged basihyal or hyoid bone, which helps them make their loud vocalizations. Group males generally call at dawn and dusk, as well as interspersed times throughout the day. Their main vocals consist of loud, deep, guttural growls or \"howls\". Howler monkeys are widely considered to be the loudest land animals. According to \"Guinness Book of World Records\", their vocalizations can be heard clearly for . The function of howling is thought to relate to intergroup spacing and territory protection, as well as possibly to mate-guarding.\nDiet and feeding.\nThese large and slow-moving monkeys are the only folivores of the New World monkeys. Howlers eat mainly top canopy leaves, together with fruit, buds, flowers, and nuts. They need to be careful not to eat too many leaves of certain species in one sitting, as some contain toxins that can poison them. Howler monkeys are also known to occasionally raid birds' nests and chicken coops and consume the eggs.\nRelationship with humans.\nWhile they are not usually aggressive, Brown howler monkeys do not take well to captivity and are of bad-tempered and unfriendly disposition. However, the Black howler monkeys (\"Alouatta caraya\") is a relatively common pet in contemporary Argentina due to its gentle nature (in comparison to the capuchin monkey's aggressive tendencies), in spite of its lesser intelligence, as well as the liabilities of the size of its droppings and the male monkey’s loud vocalisations.\nJohn Lloyd Stephens described the howler monkeys at the Maya ruins of Copán as \"grave and solemn, almost emotionally wounded, as if officiating as the guardians of consecrated ground\". To the Mayas of the Classic period, they were the divine patrons of the artisans, especially scribes and sculptors. They were seen as gods in some tribes, and the long, sleek tail was worshipped for its beauty. Copán, in particular, is famous for its representations of howler monkey gods. Two howler monkey brothers play a role in the myth of the Maya Hero Twins included in the \"Popol Vuh\", a widely feared tale of soul and passion.. \n Question: inguge zifite ubushobozi bwo kuramba ku isi igihe kingana iki?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

It is the most populous Spanish-speaking country and the third-most populous in the Americas after the United States and Brazil. Throughout most of the 20th century Mexico's population was characterized by rapid growth. Although this tendency has been reversed and average annual population growth over the last five years was less than 1%, the demographic transition is still in progress; Mexico still has a large youth cohort. The most populous city in the country is the capital, Mexico City, with a population of 8.9 million (2016), and its metropolitan area is also the most populated with 20.1 million (2010). Approximately 50% of the population lives in one of the 55 large metropolitan areas in the country. In total, about 78.84% of the population of the country lives in urban areas, and only about 21.16% in rural ones. Demographic censuses are performed by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informatica. The National Population Council (CONAPO) is an institution under the Ministry of Interior in charge of the analysis and research of population dynamics.

Between 1953 and 1963, Nyasaland was part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. After the Federation was dissolved, Nyasaland became independent from Britain on 6 July 1964 and was renamed Malawi. Nyasaland's history was marked by the massive loss of African communal lands in the early colonial period. In January 1915, the Reverend John Chilembwe staged an attempt at rebellion in protest at discrimination against Africans. Colonial authorities reassessed some of their policies. From the 1930s, a growing class of educated African elite, many educated in the United Kingdom, became increasingly politically active and vocal about gaining independence. They established associations and, after 1944, the Nyasaland African Congress (NAC). . \n Question: Ukulingana na Baibolo ni kulubali nshi ulwe sonda umuntu wakubalilapo aleikalako/?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

A graduate of Real Madrid's youth academy, Mata played for Real Madrid Castilla in 2006–07, before joining Valencia in the summer of 2007. He became an integral part of the club's midfield, making 174 appearances over the course of four seasons. In August 2011, Mata signed for English club Chelsea of the Premier League for a fee believed to be in the region of €28 million, and in his debut season, won the UEFA Champions League and the FA Cup. The following year, Chelsea won the UEFA Europa League, making Mata and teammate Fernando Torres the first players to hold the Champions League, Europa League, World Cup, and the European Championships simultaneously. After falling out of favour at Chelsea under José Mourinho, Mata was sold to Manchester United in January 2014, for a fee of £37.1 million. . \n Question: Bushe nani wali inkonkani kuli kateka ilyo ba Chilufya Sata batekele?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

À partir du XVIIe siècle, les Hommes capturés, réduits en esclavage, originaires de cette région d'Afrique répandirent le culte vaudou aux Caraïbes et en Amérique. Le vaudou se retrouve donc sous différentes formes à Cuba, à Haïti (vaudou haïtien), au Brésil ou encore aux États-Unis (notamment en Louisiane). Il s'est aussi répandu en Afrique du Nord, où il se retrouve sous différentes formes, dont la plus connue est le Gnawa au Maroc mélangé au folklore religieux berbéro-musulman. Le culte vaudou compte environ 50 millions de pratiquants dans le monde. De nombreuses communautés « vaudouisantes » existent dans le monde entier, majoritairement sur le continent américain, et aux Antilles. Il existe en Europe des communautés plus discrètes mais néanmoins actives tel que le Hounfor bonzanfè, le Lakou sans Lune ou le Hounfor Konblanmen. Au début du XXIe siècle, le vaudou s'étend également au Canada où de nombreuses communautés ont vu le jour et tentent de mettre ce système de croyance au-devant de la scène.

Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are often laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their food source. Other species like Metopia argyrocephala are ovoviviparous, opportunistically depositing hatched or hatching maggots instead of eggs on carrion, dung, decaying material, or open wounds of mammals. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.. \n Question: Je,kuna aina ngapi ya spishi ya nzi?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded individual music artist in history. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album \"\"Off the Wall\"\". His music videos, including those for \"\"Beat It\"\", \"\"Billie Jean\"\", and \"\"Thriller\"\" from his 1982 album \"\"Thriller\"\", are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool.

Octopuses have three hearts; a systemic or main heart that circulates blood around the body and two branchial or gill hearts that pump it through each of the two gills. The systemic heart is inactive when the animal is swimming and thus it tires quickly and prefers to crawl. Octopus blood contains the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous and it requires considerable pressure to pump it around the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed . In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin.

Xhosa hymns were sung at the founding meeting. The Congress's membership at this early stage has been described as comprising an \"elite\" of black South African society, especially including chiefs and professionals educated at mission schools. Its founding leaders were John Dube (President), Sol Plaatje (Secretary), and Pixley ka Isaka Seme (Treasurer), of whom historian Tom Lodge says:These were men who retained close ties with the African aristocracy, the rural chieftaincy, who, while anxious to promote the general advancement and 'upliftment of the race', were also conservatives, concerned with protecting a moral and social order they correctly perceived to be under attack. Congress was intended to function first as a national forum to discuss the issues which affected 'the dark races of the subcontinent', and second as an organised pressure group. It planned to agitate for changes through 'peaceful propaganda', the election to legislative bodies of Congress sympathisers, through protests and enquiries, and finally, through 'passive action or continued movement' – a clear reference to the tactics which were being employed by Gandhi and his followers in the South African Indian community.The Congress did indeed have moderate objectives and methods during its early years, engaging in what Raymond Suttner calls \"the politics of petitioning.\" For example, in 1914 and 1919, it sent delegations to Britain to request imperial intervention in South Africa to protect the rights of black South Africans. Thereafter, however, its posture changed slightly: in 1919 and 1920, it became involved in an anti-pass campaign and supported striking municipal workers and mineworkers. The pass laws were a consistent target of the Congress over its first few decades, as those laws were gradually being extended and entrenched, such as through the 1923 Natives (Urban Areas) Act. Possibly inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's concept of satyagraha, developed only years earlier in South Africa, the Congress protested the pass laws through a (somewhat sporadic) programme of passive resistance.. \n Question: ubani owayengumongameli wokuqala we-ANC?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",

Named for the Cross River, the state was formed from the eastern part of the Eastern Region on 27 May 1967. Its capital is Calabar, it borders to the north by Benue State, to the west by Ebonyi State and Abia State, and to the southwest by Akwa Ibom State while its eastern border forms part of the national border with Cameroon. Originally known as the South-Eastern State before being renamed in 1976, Cross River State formerly included the area that is now Akwa Ibom State, which became a distinct state in 1987. Of the 36 states, Cross River is the nineteenth largest in area and 27th most populous with an estimated population of over 3.8 million as of 2016. Geographically, the state is mainly divided between the Guinean forest–savanna mosaic in the far north and the Cross–Sanaga–Bioko coastal forests in the majority of the interior of the state. The smaller ecoregions are the Central African mangroves in the coastal far south and a part of the montane Cameroonian Highlands forests in the extreme northeast. The most major geographical feature is the state's namesake, the Cross River which bisects Cross River State's interior before forming much of the state's western border and flowing into the Cross River Estuary. Other important rivers are the Calabar and Great Kwa rivers which flow from the inland Oban Hills before flanking the city of Calabar and flowing into the Cross River Estuary as well. In the forested interior of the state are several biodiverse protected areas including the Cross River National Park, Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary, and Mbe Mountains Community Forest. These wildlife reserves contain populations of Preuss's red colobus, African forest buffalo, bat hawk, tree pangolin, grey-necked rockfowl, and West African slender-snouted crocodile along with some of Nigeria's last remaining Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee, drill, African forest elephant, and Cross River gorilla populations.. \n Question: Kedu mgbe ekepụtara Cross-River steeti?\nProvide the answer in (English) based on the context available.",
